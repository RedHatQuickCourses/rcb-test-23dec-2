= Learn to Install and Configure Ansible

== Prerequisites

Before diving into the installation and configuration of Ansible, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. A system running a supported operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL).
2. Basic understanding of command-line interfaces.
3. A text editor for creating Ansible playbooks (e.g., vim, nano, or Visual Studio Code).

== Installation

Ansible can be installed on various platforms using different methods. Here, we'll cover the installation process for Linux, macOS, and Windows (using WSL).

=== Linux

For most Linux distributions, Ansible can be installed using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, run:

[source, bash]
----
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ansible
----

For Red Hat-based systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora), use:

[source, bash]
----
$ sudo yum install epel-release
$ sudo yum install ansible
----

=== macOS

On macOS, you can use Homebrew to install Ansible:

[source, bash]
----
$ brew install ansible
----

=== Windows (with WSL)

For Windows users, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a convenient option. Follow the Linux installation instructions above once WSL is set up.

== Configuration

After installation, Ansible's configuration file is located at `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` on Linux and macOS, and `%SystemDrive%\ProgramData\ansible` on Windows. The primary configuration file is `ansible.cfg`.

=== Inventory File

The inventory file is crucial for defining the hosts managed by Ansible. By default, Ansible looks for the inventory file at `/etc/ansible/hosts` on Linux and macOS, and `%SystemDrive%\ProgramData\ansible\inventory` on Windows.

You can create a simple inventory file (`/etc/ansible/hosts` or `%SystemDrive%\ProgramData\ansible\inventory\hosts`) with the following content:

[source, text]
----
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[dbservers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com
----
